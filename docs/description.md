# Overview

Performs pathway enrichment analysis on gene sets using over-representation analysis (ORA) to identify biological pathways that are significantly enriched in the input gene list. The block uses clusterProfiler to test enrichment against Gene Ontology (GO) and Reactome pathway databases, helping to interpret the biological functions and processes associated with differentially expressed genes or other gene sets of interest.

The block takes as input gene lists (Ensembl IDs) generated by upstream analysis blocks, such as Differential Expression or Cluster Markers. The analysis supports multiple pathway collections (GO Biological Process, GO Molecular Function, GO Cellular Component, and Reactome) and outputs comprehensive enrichment results including all tested pathways with their associated statistics (p-values, adjusted p-values, gene counts) and a filtered top results table highlighting the most significantly enriched pathways.

The block uses clusterProfiler v4.14.4 for pathway enrichment analysis. When using this block in your research, cite the clusterProfiler publication (Yu et al. 2012) listed below.
